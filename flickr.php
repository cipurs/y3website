<h2>What?</h2>
<p>This is an ongoing project. As I enjoy travelling I have started posting edited images of my travels on the popular image site; Flickr.</p>
<p>One of my main hobbies is to travel the world and as such I enjoy taking my DSLR and capturing anything intersting i see whilst there. Armed with my Nikon D3200 I have taken images from places such as Norway and the Fjords as well as the Roman Forum and associated places in and about southwestern Italy. Wihtin the next year i intend to also visit; Amsterdam and also Greece!</p>
