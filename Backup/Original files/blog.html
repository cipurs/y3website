<h1>A brief look at how I made this site...</h1>
    <p>The first step I undertook to come up with the initial ideas for my website was to look at existing websites for inspiration. Upon gathering various ideas about layout and the type of things I could implement on my site I went into Photoshop and started to design the layout and styling of the webpage. Through doing this I decided that I wanted the main feature of my website to be based around images as I am a digital media student.</p>
<p>After deciding on my layout I went to adobe color, an online gallery of the most used colour schemes on the web, to select my colour scheme. As I planned my site to be based around a few images I had taken I found it to be hard to pick a consistent colour scheme that would match all of the photographs, I therefore chose to go with a very minimalistic approach of black and white. As my site background looked a bit plain and drab at this stage I went into Photoshop to create a subtle background that added a bit of colour to the site but that would still blend well with the rest of the content.</p>
<p>As the main focal point of my webpage was the images I have taken finding a relevant gallery style that would look appealing and be somewhat responsive was something I looked into for quite a large period of time. My final decision was to use a JavaScript based gallery plugin called ‘Unslider’. As I was new to java script and jQuery the ease of use and the helpful guides provided by the creators of Unslider along with the ease of calling the script up from a directory made this the obvious choice for me, not to mention how easy it is to customise and personalise.</p> 
<p>Whilst coding this website I faced a series of challenges. One such challenge was that because the main figurehead of my website was to be images I have had to sacrifice image size for quality as the images are so big and reducing the amount of colours in the .png often left the images looking very pixilated. I combatted this by first reducing the amount of images I used form around 6 to just 4 as I have achieved a file size of 100kb per large picture so as not to eat into a data allowance and relatively fast loading for people who don’t necessarily have the fastest internet connection.</p>
<p>If I was to remake this website I would very much like to use other directories I have leaned about such as animation.css and wow.css to make me site look more professional and much more fluid. On a whole when compared to <a href="http://www.ico.mmu.ac.uk/13139509/">my last website </a>I can see significant improvements not only in the cosmetics of the actual site but also how much my coding has improved in terms of ease of use by adding comments where appropriate and sectioning off significant aspects of my site.
