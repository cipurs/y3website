<h2>What?</h2>
<p>This Project was part of my university coursework for my second year unit; Website Development, to create a portfolio site.</p>
<p>The brief was to mke my own personal portfolio that followed web design best practices and showcased myself as a digital media student.</p> 
<p>Given that this project was only the second website I had designed and coded I believe that it created a great platform for me to practice new skills and try to push my skills to that next level. Looking back on the website i think that integrating a plugin such as unslider to create an interactive gallery was a good idea in principle but it takes a long time to load as the plugin was external.</p>
